# Restful-Api-Using-SpringBoot
The project is implemented using Spring Boot with Spring Data JPA for managing student records. It provides endpoints to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student data. The application uses Postgresql Database to store student records also Spring Data JPA is a subproject of the Spring Data project that showcases the support for working with JPA (Java Persistence API) in Spring applications.

# Testing:

The project has been tested using Postman to make HTTP requests to the API endpoints and verify the responses. The provided sample requests in the generated-requests.http file demonstrate how to interact with the API to add, retrieve, update, and delete student records.
